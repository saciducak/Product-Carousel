### Data Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Check homepage → Load favorites → Fetch/retrieve products → Render carousel
2. **User Interaction**: Click/Touch → Update state → Save to storage → Update UI

- Price display (with discount if applicable)
- Favorite button (heart icon)
- Add to cart button

### Navigation
- Previous/Next arrow buttons

## 💾 Storage Schema

### Products Cache
```javascript
{
  "carousel_products_data": [...],      // Product array
  "last_data_fetch_time": "timestamp",  // Cache timestamp
  "user_favorite_items": [1, 2, 3]      // Favorite IDs
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Key settings can be adjusted in the CONFIG object:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  API_URL: 'your-api-endpoint',
  CAROUSEL_TITLE: 'Your title',
  CACHE_DURATION: 3600000, // 1 hour
  ITEMS_PER_VIEW: {
    DESKTOP: 5,
    TABLET: 3,
    MOBILE: 2
  }
}
